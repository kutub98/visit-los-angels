        'In his LA Times review of Burritos La Palma, the late Jonathan Gold described the birria burrito as captivating and months later named it one of the five best burritos in  LA. A spotlight in the burrito episode of Netflix is Taco Chronicles (Season 2) re-ignited the fervor for Burritos La   Palma. The Zacatecan-style birria burrito is elegant in its   simplicity - spicy shredded beef is wrapped in a handmade,buttery flour tortilla and crisped to a golden brown. That is  it. The compact burritos are smaller than the behemoths   typically served around town, so two or three is a typical   order. You can ask for the burrito con todo, which adds refried beans and cheese. The Platillo Especial features two   birria burritos covered in green chile pork sauce and  cheese, served with refried beans, lettuce and tomato on the side.',
